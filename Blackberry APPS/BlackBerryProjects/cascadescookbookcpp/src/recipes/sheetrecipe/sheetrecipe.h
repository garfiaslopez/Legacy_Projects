/* SheetRecipe Description:
 *
 * In the Sheet recipe, a sheet is primarily used to present UI concerned with
 * creating or selection of content. Sheets are also typically used 
 * when changing context to a temporary sub-flow that contains a more complex entry 
 * or an entry that has more than one step (more than one screen).
 * In this recipe, this is illustrated by a bowl of fruit. The content of the bowl
 * can be modified and a drill-down flow consisting of two Sheets is shown.
