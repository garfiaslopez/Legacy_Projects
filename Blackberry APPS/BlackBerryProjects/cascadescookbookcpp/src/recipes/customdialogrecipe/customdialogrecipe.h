 * CustomDialogRecipe Description:
 * 
 * A CustomDialog is a full-screen view that is displayed as a transparent layer on top
 * of the current screen. Basically, it's a separate view within the current application.
 * The use-case of the dialog is similar to Sheet, in that it is used when something happens
 * out-side the normal UI flow, like e.g. an alarm or message is triggered.
 * In this recipe shows how a CustomDialog is created and shown as a cozy candle triggers
 * the fire alarm.
