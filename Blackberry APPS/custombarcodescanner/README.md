CustomBarcodeScanner

This is a custom barcode scanner that demonstrates how to process the preview frames from the camera. If you just want to scan barcodes, you probably want to take a look at the BarcodeReader sample, which walks you through using the built-in BarcodeDetector component.

This app demonstrates:
1) How to create a custom component (BarcodeDecoder)
2) How to process preview frames from the camera
3) How to use the ZXing library
4) How to act as a Card
5) How to use the Camera.

The BarcodeInvoker app demonstrates how to invoke this app as a card.
